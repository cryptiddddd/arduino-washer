# 3D Part Washer Design

This document outlines the design of this 3D part washer.

Note that measurement specifications will be absent, as this document explains the needs and philosophy of the machine.


## Machine Design

[TODO: include labelled drawing.]

The machine has two stepper motors:
- A motor in the back that moves the washer arm vertically.
- A motor in the front that rotates the wash basket.
