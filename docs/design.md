# 3D Part Washer Design

> Note that the intention of this document is to only explain what is necessary to work with the machine from the side of programming. I did not assemble the machine or its Arduino, and to explain it would unfortunately be out of my reach.


## Machine Design

[physical design + drawing + labelling + glossary]

The machine has two stepper motors:
- A motor in the back that moves the washer arm vertically.
- A motor in the front that rotates the wash basket.


## Wash Process Design
