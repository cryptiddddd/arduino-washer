Welcome to the docs for an Arduino-powered 3D-printed part washer.

These files are written for those who will next maintain the code, with the intention of making it much easier.

For the machine's overall design, see [design](./design.md). I suggest starting here.

For a guide to `main.ino`, see [code guide](./code_guide.md).

For notes on used Arduino libraries, and links to their documentation, see [dependencies](./dependencies.md).
