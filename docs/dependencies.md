## Dependencies

This program uses the AccelStepper Arduino library, built by Mike McCauley. [View documentation here.](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html)

This program also uses the ezButton Arduino library. I have not viewed the documentation on this package yet, as I find it rather simple. Perhaps I will look into it later.

This program has been using the default Stepper Arduino library, but it honestly might not be needed anymore, so I will likely be removing it?
